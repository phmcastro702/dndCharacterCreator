Using HTML, JavaScript and CSS, I'm basically calling a Dungeons & Dragons api based on the user choices of characters atributes and the goal is to
organize all that character information that comes from the api into a dynamic character sheet to play D&D. (or maybe this will just be an information web page of
D&D lore)
